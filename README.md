## 2. Course Management
    -Course creation by instructors with features like:
    -Adding courses, uploading videos, course thumbnails, and descriptions.
    -Adding chapters, lessons, and MCQs.
    -Adding lesson related tutorial(text-based)
    -Price settings.
    -Managing live sessions and discussion forums.
    -Support for multiple categories and tags for better course discovery.
    -Integration of discounts and coupons.
    -Ratings and reviews for courses.
